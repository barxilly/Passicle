# Passicle
Passicle is a password generator that uses a unique key and the name of the account / service you need a password for to generate a password. This means that you only need to remember one key and the name of the account / service to generate a password. This is a lot more secure than using the same password for every account / service you use, and a lot easier than remembering a different password for every account / service you use.
