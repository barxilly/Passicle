# Passicle
Passicle is a password generator that uses a unique key and the name of the account / service you need a password for to generate a password. This means that you only need to remember one key and the name of the account / service to generate a password. This is a lot more secure than using the same password for every account / service you use, and a lot easier than remembering a different password for every account / service you use.
No version of passicle stores any data, and all but the web version can be used online.

## How it works
Passicle uses a custom encryption algorithm to generate passwords. The algorithm ensures that the generated passwords are always the same for the same key and account / service name.
The algorithm is also one-way meaning that it is impossible to decrypt the generated passwords to get the key or account / service name.
