<h1>v2 Alpha</h1>
<p>The v2 Alpha is the next version of Passicle. It is not yet available in its compiled form, but feel free to dig about in the source code.</p>
<p>The encryption algorithm used in v2 will be a lot more secure, and will be able to generate passwords of any length, and with any amount of special characters.</p>
<p>I also have plans to integrate a password manager into v2 Alpha, and passkey integration.</p>
<p>If all goes well, v2 will be released in early 2024, with versions for Web, Windows, Linux, and Android.</p>
<p><sup>I did have plans to release an iOS version, but Apple requires a $99/year subscription to release apps on the App Store, so I will not be releasing an iOS version.</sup></p>
<p>While this is all sunshine and rainbows, I do have to make it clear that <strong>passwords generated with v1 will not be compatible with v2</strong>. This is because the encryption algorithm used in v2 Alpha is completely different to the one used in v1.X.X.</p>
